# MyDailyList
MyDailyList app made using Xamarin for Android.
My Daily List is a mobile application I am working on that allows a user to create a static list that remains the
same each day and items can be set to a complete status as they go throughout their day. On the start of a new day
the items are reset to not complete. Additional functionality such as alarms/reminders are intended to be added.

A recent android update changed the way notifications are handled and as such caused all of my notifications to crash the app. As such, until it is fixed they are disabled.
